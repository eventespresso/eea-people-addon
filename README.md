EE People Addon
=========

This addon for Event Espresso adds the people post type.   This initially allows for relationships between people and events but eventually (in later iterations) will allow for relationships between people and venues, and even people and attendees (contacts)!

### What are "people"?
People are whatever you want them to be!  People could be "sponsors", speakers", they could be "staff", or even "volunteers".  This addon puts the power in your hands to classify people and easily attach them to events.
