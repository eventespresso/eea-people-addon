== Description ==
Event organizers pick Event Espresso for handling registrations for events like conferences, nonprofit events, classes, workshops, and more.

With the People Manager add-on, you can create profiles about different people that help with your event. Then feature that information on events that you choose.

Here are a few ways that our event organizers use the People Manager add-on for their events:

– Define instructors for different classes at multiple locations
– Show upcoming events for a particular teacher
– Manage volunteer event staff
– Display conference sponsors, exhibitors, and speakers

== Installation ==
Event Espresso is required to use this add-on. Once Event Espresso is installed, you can install this plugin like any other plugin. 

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress > Plugins > Add New screen directly.
